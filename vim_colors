On RHEL 7.x, to set the default color scheme on vim, you can do it per vim session OR permanently this way:
Per vim session
  once in vim, enter ":color desert"  (remove quotes) into vim cli
  Hint:  color is short for colorscheme  and if you type ":colorscheme " (add a space!) and tab, all the possible color combinations will cycle through.
  this will change the colors for that session only, as soon as you close and come back it will return to previous color scheme
  
Change Default VIM Color Scheme
  at least on RHEL, it seems if you edit the /etc/vimrc file by adding this ine (or uncommenting it as the case may be):
    set background=dark
  it will change your default vim colors henceforth
